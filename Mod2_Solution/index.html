			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>
			Experience - and common sense - tells us that the better birds are cared for, the better the quality and flavour of the chicken they produce. Therefore we tuck in our chicken every night and we read them bedtime stories. This makes our chicken the best out there!

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
			Our farmers know that cattle should develop their muscle for the most tasty meat. Therefore we train our cows 5 days a week. Push-ups, deadlifts, benchpresses, you call it. These cows are healthy, buff and they sometimes win the Mister Olympia, but most of all they are extraordinarily tasty.
